CompostMe was created with the objective of bringing together people who wish to compost their biowaste but do not have the necessary facilities at home / do not know whare to bring biowaste, and people who wish to up their compost production by collecting biowaste from others. 

CompostMe also aims at referencing collective composts that are managed by associations, cities, etc...

CompostMe is a constant WIP (seriously, you should see the to-do list), with lots of new features and improvements on the cards. Feel free to collaborate, regardless of your skill level or expertise :)
